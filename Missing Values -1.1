## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

#Cleaning Bad Data with R - 1 - Missing Values
#Rushikesh Maheshwari

```{r}
setwd("C:/Users/Admin/Documents/Handling Bad data with R")
install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
```

#Here we are trying to handle the missing values in a data set with tidyverse package

#Loading the data
```{r}
d <- read_csv("heating.csv")
```

# Tidy the data
```{r}
d <- gather(d,key="age", value = "homes", -Source,convert = FALSE) 
#This function helps us to reshape the data so as to perform analysis
summary(d)
```

#Mutating homes to numeric
```{r}
mutate(d,homes = as.numeric(homes))
```
#The error above means that there are NA's introduced because some of the data could not be converted into numeric format

# Find those values where we have NA
```{r}
filter(d,is.na(as.numeric(homes)))
```

#We now mutate these non-numerical data into numerical value below
```{r}
d %>% 
  mutate(homes = ifelse(homes ==".",0,homes)) %>%
  mutate(homes = ifelse(homes == "Z",0,homes)) %>%
  mutate(homes = as.numeric(homes)) %>%
  filter(Source == "Cooking stove")
```
#With filter function, we could cross-check if the NA's are converted into numeric values or not. Now that they are, we have to store the result back, permanently 

```{r}
d = d %>% 
  mutate(homes = ifelse(homes ==".",0,homes)) %>%
  mutate(homes = ifelse(homes == "Z",0,homes)) %>%
  mutate(homes = as.numeric(homes))

summary(d)
```

#Now we see no NA values in Data !
## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
